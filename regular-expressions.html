// Regular expressions is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern 
// Site to use to understand regex is https://regexr.com/
// General syntax
//    /pattern/flag
// Flags- they are appended at the end of a regex literal(second argument to a regular expression)
// They are used in altering the behaviour of a regex
// Examples of regex flags are:
    // g- global. Finds all matches instead of stopping after the first
    // i- case insensitive. /[a-z]/ is equivalent to /[a-zA-Z]
    // m- Multiline. ^ and $ match the beginning and the end of each line respectivley treating \n and \r as delimiters
    // u- Unicode. If this flag is not supported you must match the specific Unicode characters with \uXXXX where XXXX is the characters value in hexadecimal
    // y- sticky. Finds all consecutive/adjacent matches  

// Patterns- Brackets are used to find the range of characters
// Examples of patterns:
        // [a-z]- Finds a lower case character from a to z
        // [0-9]- Finds any digit between 0 to 9
        // [a-z|0-9]- Finds any character of digits
//Quantifiers- define the number of occurrences of a string
// Examples of quantifiers
        //N+ - + indicates one or more occurrences of the character n
        //N* - * indicates zero or more occurrences of the character n
        //N? - ? indicates zero or one occurrence of character n
    // eg:a*b* selects zero or more a's followed by zero or more b's

// \w - matches any word character
// \W - matches any non-word characters
// \s - matches any whitespaces
// \s - matches any non- whitespaces ie: characters
// \d - matches any digits
// \D - matches any non-digits
// \d{3}- groups the digits in 3's
// \w{3}- groups the words in 3's
// \w{3,4}- groups words in 3's or 4's
