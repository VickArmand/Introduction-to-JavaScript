     <p>With the apply() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
        The apply() method is similar to the call() method.
     </p>   
        <p>The Difference Between call() and apply()
            The difference is:
            
            The call() method takes arguments separately.
            
            The apply() method takes arguments as an array.</p>
