       <p>Inheritance is useful for code reusability: reuse properties and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.</p>

// To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.
// A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods
// from another class:      
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
  }
}

let myCar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myCar.show();
// The super() method refers to the parent class.
// By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's
//  properties and methods.

// Classes also allows you to use getters and setters.
// It can be smart to use getters and setters for your properties, 
// especially if you want to do something special with the value before returning them, or before you set them.
// To add getters and setters in the class, use the get and set keywords.
class Car2 {
  constructor(brand) {
    this._carname = brand;
  }
  get carname() {
    return this._carname;
  }
  set carname(x) {
    this._carname = x;
  }
}

let myCar2 = new Car2("Ford");
myCar2.carname = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myCar2.carname;
// Note: even if the getter is a method, you do not use parentheses when you want to get the property value.
// The name of the getter/setter method cannot be the same as the name of the property, in this case carname.
// Many programmers use an underscore character _ before the property name to separate the getter/setter from the actual property:





// Hoisting
// Unlike functions, and other JavaScript declarations, class declarations are not hoisted.
// That means that you must declare a class before you can use it:
