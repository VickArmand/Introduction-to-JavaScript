//JS is single threaded hence being slow and restrictive since commands execute in a sequence. 
// With the help of promises and otherAsynchronous concepts, 
// JS can perform long requests simultaneously without blocking the main thread 

// A JavaScript Promise object contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code:
// A promise is an asynchronous action that 
// may complete at some point in future and produce a value.
// It notifies the user when its value is available
// It avoids the problem of deeply nested callbacks
// States of promises 
        //Pending- Underlying operation is not completed
        // Fulfilled- Operation is finished, and the promise is fulfilled with a value
        // Rejected- An error has occurred during the operation and the promise is rejected with a reason
// A promise is settled when it is either fulfilled or rejected
// Once a promise is settled, it becomes immutable and its state cannot change
// then()- is used to attach a callback when the promise is fulfilled
// catch(callback)- used to attach a callback when a promise is rejected
